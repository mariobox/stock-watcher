# stock-watcher
A real time app to watch a portfolio of stocks.
Input a selection of stock symbols and the app will display them in neatly laid out cards.
Information refreshes every 10 seconds.
Since each stock occupies half the screen (in medium to large viewports) you can use the app to compare two companies in the same industry at a time, like WMT and TGT, or AAL and LUV.
The app uses jQuery's getJSON method to get information from https://iextrading.com/ free API.
